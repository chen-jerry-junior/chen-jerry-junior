I am having the Master of Science degree in Computer Science at the University of California San Diego. I achieved my bachelor degree at the National University of Singapore. I am interested in fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Computer Graphics and Games, Database Systems, and Software Engineering. I hope to further expand in these fields and I am looking forward to meeting some awesome people.

    * Resolved CPU core mismatch on the Zombie Cloud server webpage with optimized SQL queries.

## Research Experience
- VR Gamification in Cryoablation of Breast Tumor | Research Assistant | Singapore | Aug 2024 - Present
    * Collaborated with NUS’s medical school to develop a VR game of Cryoablation simulator through Unreal Engine, gamifying surgery precedures to promote access to Cryoabolation, a newly introduced surgery technique for breast tumor in Singapore.
    * Implemented key features including an in-game tablet for surgery planning, ultrasound imaging for 2D cross-sectional views of the breast, a cryoablation probe simulating a real-world cryoablation device, surgery complications, a point system displaying users’ steps, etc.
    * Working on inviting medical students and surgeons to test for game optimization, pitching to companies such as ICEfx for funding, and preparing the game launch and paper.

- Memory Assisted LLM Recommendation System | Research Assistant | Remote | Jun 2024 - Present
    * Developed an LLM-based recommendation system with ‘memory’ to research better recommendation precision with personalized history. Consolidated and analyzed user history with LLM before conducting recommendation tasks.
    * Extracted memory from each user preference data/watching history. Applied memory to predict ratings for unseen preferences, sorting memory by genre similarity.
    * Conducted extensive experiments on movie rating prediction tasks with MovieLens 100K Dataset. Improved memory efficiency and identified movie correlations by integrating external knowledge (e.g. IMDB rating, Director, Stars, etc).
    * Paper submitted to The Web Conference, under review.

- Private VR Chat Channels User Experiences in Casual Social | Developer | Singapore | Aug 2023 - Present
  - NUS Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme, under supervision by Prof. Anand Bhojan
    * Researched related voice control in the VR metaverse to improve user experiences.
    * Built simulators to model user scenarios and quantify user experiences. Formulated and tested four research questions to enhance user experience through private chat channels in social virtual reality.
    * Analyzed APIs of major VR platforms to design and test a private communication channel packet for enhanced user privacy.
    * Paper submitted to ACM MMSys, under review.

- Photo De-hazing Using Machine Learning Techniques | Changsha, China | May 2023 - Jul 2023
  - Research Assistant at Hunan University, under supervision by Prof. Huailiang Tan
    * Implemented a photo de-hazing AI model to gain proficiency in image processing through machine learning.
    * Learned image processing acceleration through GPU and Cuda technology.
    
## Projects
